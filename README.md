# Katas
 
## About

A collection of the coding Katas that I did during my training at MYOB. Through these katas I learnt a lot about many different aspects of software development.

### Game of Life

An implementation of Conway's Game of life algorithm, where the user can pick the board size. The focus for this kata was to improve my abstraction and utalisation of MVC principles.

### Payslip and Payslip-Refactored

The payslip kata was the very first kata that I built, and then I revisited it again at the end of my training to implement all that I had learnt. The code in `payslip` is my first attempt, which I have kept as a reminder to myself that all code can be improved. `payslip-refactored` is my re-implementation of the same problem.

### Refactoring Kata

This kata helped me to learn test-driven development (TDD). The idea was to refactor the code from unusable and unreadable until it became fast, elegent, and usable. There was a test-suite that was used to practice the idea of "Red, Green, Refactor", which meant that we could check that any changes we made to the code still performed the desired task.

For this kata, I implemented an `O(log(n))` heap sorting algorithm in order to sort faster, as this helped to cement my understanding of sorting algorithms rather than simply using one built into C#.

### Tic Tac Toe

An implementation of the classic game of tic-tac-toe. Users can select their own symbols, and decide who is going first. A single player can even play against an AI player if they want to test their skills.
